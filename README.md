# Movie-Recommendation-System


The Data is cleaned in the Folder MovieLensDataset_Preprocessing, They output two final files which are ratings_final.csv and movies_data_final.csv. These files are used in the Movie Recommendation System.

Since the original data file is so large one cannot push it on github, so data is cleaned and then used in the Movie Recommendation System. They are pushed on github with the name ratings_final.csv and movies_data_final.csv. The that folder is uploaded on google at the link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1prFo3LGfErslzkv1FiD1MX2jjZ_o-LC9?usp=sharing
