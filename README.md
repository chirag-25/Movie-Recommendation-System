# Movie-Recommendation-System


This project is a comprehensive movie recommendation system that utilizes four different types of recommendation algorithms to provide users with personalized movie recommendations. These four types of recommendation systems are:


1. Top-N recommendation
2. Content-based recommendation
3. Collaborative recommendation
4. Hybrid-based recommendation


The Top-N approach involves recommending a set of top movies to a new user who has not yet provided any information or preferences to the recommendation system. Top-N recommendation is a simple and effective approach that is often used as a baseline for evaluating recommendation systems.


The content-based recommendation system, on the other hand, uses the features of a movie, such as its plot, genre, and keywords, to make recommendations. This system is particularly useful for users who are looking for movies that are similar to ones they have already enjoyed.


The collaborative recommendation system uses the behavior and preferences of similar users to make recommendations. This system is particularly useful for users who are looking for recommendations based on the preferences of other users with similar tastes.


Finally, the hybrid recommendation system combines two or more of the above recommendation systems to provide more accurate and personalized recommendations.


By using all four types of recommendation systems, our project aims to provide the most
comprehensive and accurate movie recommendations possible, tailored to each individual
userâ€™s preferences and viewing history. This will enhance the overall movie watching experience for users, and provide valuable insights for businesses looking to improve user engagement and satisfaction.

#### About Dataset

The Data is cleaned in the Folder MovieLensDataset_Preprocessing, They output two final files which are ratings_final.csv and movies_data_final.csv. These files are used in the Movie Recommendation System.

Since the original data file is so large one cannot push it on github, so data is cleaned and then used in the Movie Recommendation System. They are pushed on github with the name ratings_final.csv and movies_data_final.csv. The that folder is uploaded on [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1prFo3LGfErslzkv1FiD1MX2jjZ_o-LC9?usp=sharing)
